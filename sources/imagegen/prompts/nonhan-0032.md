## Exact tool prompt

```text
Use case: font-source raster sheet
Asset type: high-resolution 4×4 raster master sheet for original non-Han
glyphs in the Clear Hand TC family

Input images:
1. Image 1 (`sources/imagegen/raster/common-0001.png`, SHA-256 `2a4058fdb4e35ce2789f9ae73535542f78f4e94516ad4b9929986a93e36d3d81`) is STYLE ONLY.
   Match its fine black gel-pen weight, rounded terminals, natural but
   controlled handwriting rhythm, optical scale, pure-white background, and
   faint 4×4 grid. Do not copy its Han characters.
2. Image 2 (`sources/imagegen/copybooks/nonhan-0032.png`, SHA-256 `f6e5b2934ea95dd0284c6e0dfb60553c7576efa8b23c4025a2af6e9d8749f203`) is IDENTITY
   REFERENCE ONLY. It uses neutral local print fonts to disambiguate the exact
   Unicode glyph in each corresponding cell. Do not trace, reproduce, or
   import its printed outlines. Do not reproduce its gray grid geometry.

Primary request: draw exactly 16 new isolated glyphs in a
strict four-by-four grid, in the exact row-major cell order below. Author each
glyph as original Clear Hand TC handwriting from a blank canvas.

Design group: `P16-MARK-COMBINING`
Metric/design profiles present: `nonspacing-mark`
- [nonspacing-mark] Draw only the requested combining-mark ink, enlarged enough to identify in its cell; do not add a base, dotted circle, or carrier glyph.
- [nonspacing-mark] The final font metric is zero advance; the raster cell is an identity capture canvas, not evidence of final spacing.

Unused cells: All sixteen cells are occupied.

Identity-critical anatomy:
- Draw only each isolated combining mark, never a carrier or dotted circle.
- Cell 05 is exactly three components on one line: a filled dot at left, one
  rising acute stroke in the center, and a filled dot at right. It is not a
  tilde, double acute, or two strokes without the two dots.
- Cell 07 is one bridge shaped like `Π`; Cell 08 is exactly two horizontal
  bars; Cell 09 is exactly two vertical bars.
- Cell 10 is the single angular corner shown in the copybook, with a horizontal
  top and a descending right stem.
- Cell 11 is one tilde crossed by one diagonal slash.
- Cell 12 is one tilde with exactly two detached filled dots: one above and
  one below. Never omit the lower dot.
- Cell 13 is exactly two stacked wavy strokes; Cells 14–16 are respectively
  one left-right arrow, one upward arrow, and one right arrowhead.

Composition: square image; four equal rows and four equal columns; generous
outer margin; only faint thin light-gray straight separators; exactly one
centered black target glyph in every occupied cell. Keep all black ink well
away from separators. Use pure white with no texture, gradient, lighting, or
shadow.

Constraints: preserve every requested Unicode identity, direction, topology,
dot, line count, enclosure, fill state, and paired distinction; output each
target exactly once and only in its assigned cell; keep the style handwritten
and legible at small text sizes. The identity copybook is evidence, never an
outline source.

Do not include any U+XXXX label, Unicode name, cell number, caption, legend,
dotted-circle carrier, annotation, signature, logo, or watermark. Do not
render anything in unused cells. Avoid typeset appearance, brush blobs, dry
brush, ink splatter, sharp miter spikes, thorn-like protrusions, clipping,
duplicate glyphs, missing glyphs, reordered cells, or connected cells.
