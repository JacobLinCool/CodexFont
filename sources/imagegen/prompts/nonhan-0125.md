## Exact tool prompt

```text
Use case: font-source raster sheet
Asset type: high-resolution 4×4 raster master sheet for original non-Han
glyphs in the Clear Hand TC family

Input images:
1. Image 1 (`sources/imagegen/raster/common-0001.png`, SHA-256 `2a4058fdb4e35ce2789f9ae73535542f78f4e94516ad4b9929986a93e36d3d81`) is STYLE ONLY.
   Match its fine black gel-pen weight, rounded terminals, natural but
   controlled handwriting rhythm, optical scale, pure-white background, and
   faint 4×4 grid. Do not copy its Han characters.
2. Image 2 (`sources/imagegen/copybooks/nonhan-0125.png`, SHA-256 `627b94e5232deb435ca0c150a8d88ae27da667d268cd77e37afb80f6c66d0151`) is IDENTITY
   REFERENCE ONLY. It uses neutral local print fonts to disambiguate the exact
   Unicode glyph in each corresponding cell. Do not trace, reproduce, or
   import its printed outlines. Do not reproduce its gray grid geometry.

Primary request: draw exactly 16 new isolated glyphs in a
strict four-by-four grid, in the exact row-major cell order below. Author each
glyph as original Clear Hand TC handwriting from a blank canvas.

Design group: `P52-LETTERLIKE`
Metric/design profiles present: `proportional`
- [proportional] Keep natural proportional side bearings and optical width; do not force the glyph into a fullwidth square.

Critical identity corrections:
- Cell 03 is U+2132 TURNED CAPITAL F, never a normal capital F or script F.
  Preserve the copybook's turned silhouette exactly: its vertical stem is on
  the right and its two horizontal arms extend left.
- Cell 11 is U+213A ROTATED CAPITAL Q, never a lowercase q or ordinary Q.
  Preserve the copybook's rotated capital-Q oval, tail placement, and tail
  orientation exactly; do not give it a lowercase descender.
- Cell 04 U+2133 SCRIPT CAPITAL M must keep its exact flowing capital-M
  topology while every terminal, turn, joining point, inner corner, and outer
  corner remains softly rounded. Its hairline entry and exit strokes must end
  in clean rounded caps, with no acute wedge, thorn, spike, sharp cusp,
  needle, or one-pixel protrusion anywhere.
- Cells 13–16 are double-struck symbols. Preserve their visible parallel
  contours, inner strokes, and clean white channels. In particular, Cell 16
  must remain the double-struck reversed summation U+2140, not a plain sigma
  or ordinary summation sign. Keep these identities legible despite the
  handwritten style.

Unused cells: All sixteen cells are occupied.

Composition: square image; four equal rows and four equal columns; generous
outer margin; only faint thin light-gray straight separators; exactly one
centered black target glyph in every occupied cell. Keep all black ink well
away from separators. Use pure white with no texture, gradient, lighting, or
shadow.

Constraints: preserve every requested Unicode identity, direction, topology,
dot, line count, enclosure, fill state, and paired distinction; output each
target exactly once and only in its assigned cell; keep the style handwritten
and legible at small text sizes. The identity copybook is evidence, never an
outline source.

Do not include any U+XXXX label, Unicode name, cell number, caption, legend,
dotted-circle carrier, annotation, signature, logo, or watermark. Do not
render anything in unused cells. Avoid typeset appearance, brush blobs, dry
brush, ink splatter, sharp miter spikes, thorn-like protrusions, clipping,
duplicate glyphs, missing glyphs, reordered cells, or connected cells.
